# Data Management course project #
JSON is a popular textual data format that's used for exchanging data in modern web and mobile applications. JSON is also used for storing unstructured data in log files or NoSQL databases.

- Choose a MongoDB that manages JSON documents. Given a large number of JSON documents, I created a document database based on this data.
- JSON to Relationa: I parse the data and create a relational database dbjson corresponding to it. I study the data first and propose a relational schema for it and minimize redundancy.
- Comparative Studies: Given a number of queries and tasks to complete over the 2 databases, their performances are compared.
- Optimize databases: introduce indices.
